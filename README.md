### In this Web Scraping project, I gather important product detail information from an online book store
### Some of the information collected is Title, Price and Star Rating 
### I found this exercise to be incredily important because I created a function to iterate over the multiple pages of the website
### Furthermore, this is valuable in additional projects with multiple pages of information that needs to be collected

### From the stand point of data analysis, Web Scraping is valuable in creating specified collections of data
### The data with which I collected could be used to better understand pricing strategies and consumer taste preferences

### Thank you for reading me and enjoy this project ðŸ˜ƒ
